Complex-Scaling
===============

Brute force odes to solve the complex scaled Schrodinger problem.  Note these are not very scalable and are for testing model systems.  Includes:

fgh1dcs.m - Fourier Grid Hamiltonian method in 1D,
multistep.m - Multistep scattering method,
model_interacting.m - Interacting FDM method for two particles,
model_independent.m - Independent particles FDM,
kohn_sham_scf.m - DFRT (Density Functional Resonance Theory) method for 2 interacting particles
